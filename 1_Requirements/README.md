## Introduction 
Tic-tac-toe (American English), noughts and crosses (British English), or Xs
and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking
the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a
horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row wins the game.


## Identifying Features 
The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.
You are X, your friend (or the computer in this case) is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
The first player to get 3 of her marks in a row (up, down, across, or diagonally) is the winner.
When all 9 squares are full, the game is over.
